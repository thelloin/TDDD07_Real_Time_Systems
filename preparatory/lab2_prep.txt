****************** Laboration 2 - Preparatory questions *********************

1. What is the role of the go-ahead message?

The role of the go-ahead message is a form of confirmation from the mission control to the robot, that
the message was sent in the approperiate time-slot and that it was recieved. If no go-ahead message is
recieved after a transmission, the robot will stop until a go-ahead message is recieved.

2. What are the different message types?

The message types are as follows:
*Victim reports - are sent when a victim is found (critical)

*Location messages - contains information about the robots position. If positional information is not
	  	     conveyed to mission control no go-ahead message will be recieved.
 
*Pheromone maps - Indicates which areas have been searched by all robots. Old pheromone maps are reduntant.
	   
*Stream data - emulates video transmission, should be transmitted if there is room in the message (should be considered as non-critical).

3. In which files will the solutions for lab 2 go?

Solutions will go in tasks/task_communicate.c. There might be need for some changes to scheduler.c, depending on lab 1 implementation (for task_communicate to be run within approperiate time-slot).

4. How can you make sure that the robot only sends messages within its allocated time slot?

All robots will be communicating with the same mission control. Therefore robot clock has to be synchronized with the mission control clock so that they have the same notion of _current_ time. The scheduler needs to have a be implemented so that the major cycle equals one full time cycle, ie so that communication occurs in the same timeslot every major cycle.
